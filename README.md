Github: https://github.com/PrLamkin/Posh-Portfolio-PRL
Deployed: https://prlamkin.github.io/Posh-Portfolio-PRL/

Welcome to the instructional guide on how to use the webpage! From the homepage you're able to navigate to any of the three locations from the nav bar at the top of the page. at any time if you want to go back to marvel at the lovely home page, just press the home button at the top. If you find you're at the portfolio page, press any of the three iamges to be brought to the deployed product.
